# CNN-image-classification-model
Used Convolutional Neural Network model to classify an image dataset on Kaggle containing about 43 predefined classes and more than 50,000 images in total.
Link of the dataset on Kaggle:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign?resource=download

I divided the dataset into 10 unequal parts randomly and using them I trained my ML model for image classification and plot a bar graph to compare the results.
