# CNN-image-classification-model
Used Convolutional Neural Network model to classify an image dataset on Kaggle containing about 43 predefined classes and more than 50,000 images in total.

I divided the dataset into 10 unequal parts randomly and using them I trained my ML model for image classification and plot a bar graph to compare the results.
